<p>On December 6, 2015 in response to general calls for a protest starting at 5pm, people began to gather at Bancroft Way and Telegraph Avenue. Internet announcements and unsigned flyers had been distributed in previous days. As noted by BPD, one flyer had a picture of a person sitting on top of an overturned police car and another one said, “Fuck the Police”. (1)</p>

<p>However, the culture of Berkeley and the national visibility of the failure of the grand juries in both the case of Daren Wilson (cop who shot Mike Brown) and Daniel Pantaleo (cop who choked Eric Garner to death) ensured that residents of Berkeley would attend the protest regardless of who called for the demonstration or what graphics accompanied the call.</p>
